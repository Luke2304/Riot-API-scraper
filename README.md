# Match Scraper for League of Legends

This is a match scraper that uses Riot's API to retrieve statistics of a match.

After cloning the repository, you will need to:  

1.Retrieve your specific match ID, which can be found through https://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/. In the url of your match, the first 10 digit number will be your match ID.

2.Get a Riot API developer key. Go to https://developer.riotgames.com/ and follow the instructions.

3.Go to `main.py` and fill in your `match ID` and `Riot Developer API Key`. Run by simply typing `python main.py` in terminal.
